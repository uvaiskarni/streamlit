# AI Butler

## Overview
AI Butler is an advanced tool designed to assist recruiters by providing context-aware, tailored responses based on a candidate's experience. It integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate personalized answers from a stored vector database. This tool enhances the hiring process by providing recruiters with insightful, relevant information about candidates, helping streamline decision-making.

## Code Overview

### **AI_butler.py**
- **Purpose**: 
  - Serves as the main script for the AI Butler application.
  - Acts as the frontend interface, allowing users to interact with the system.
- **Features**:
  - **Streamlit Interface**:
    - Provides a user-friendly, web-based interface for interaction.
    - Enables users to input questions directly into the system.
    - Displays answers generated by the RAG system.
  - **Initialization**:
    - Sets up the vector database and LLM for use.
    - Prepares the environment for processing questions and storing responses.
  - **RAG Integration**:
    - Uses the LLM to retrieve and generate contextually relevant answers based on the stored vector database.
    - Ensures that answers are tailored to the specific experience and requirements of the candidate being assessed.
  - **Logging**:
    - Maintains logs of system activities, including questions asked, answers generated, and any errors encountered.
    - Facilitates troubleshooting and monitoring of the system’s performance.
  - **Resource Management**:
    - Supports GPU cleanup after processing.
    - Manages system shutdown to conserve resources when not in use.

### **rag_libs.py**
- **Purpose**:
  - Contains the backend functions required for processing documents and generating answers.
- **Features**:
  - **Document Processing**:
    - Supports processing various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
    - Extracts and prepares the necessary text for vectorization.
  - **Vector Embeddings**:
    - Creates vector embeddings of the processed documents.
    - Utilizes advanced embedding techniques to capture the semantic meaning of the text.
  - **RAG Interaction**:
    - Interfaces with the RAG system to generate answers.
    - Retrieves the most relevant documents from the vector database based on the query.
    - Uses the LLM to generate a coherent, contextually accurate response.
  - **Vector Database Management**:
    - Manages the vector database using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
    - Performs fast similarity searches to retrieve the most relevant documents for answering a question.
    - Allows dynamic updating of the database with new documents.
  - **Error Handling**:
    - Includes mechanisms for handling errors that may arise during document processing or RAG interaction.
    - Ensures robustness in the system’s operation, even in the presence of incomplete or ambiguous input.

## How to Use
1. **Initialize**:
   - Click the "Initialize System" button on the Streamlit interface.
   - This loads the vector database and initializes the LLM.
   - Prepares the system for receiving and processing questions.
2. **Ask a Question**:
   - Enter your question directly into the Streamlit interface.
   - Press Ctrl+Enter or use the right-side button to submit.
   - The system uses RAG to retrieve relevant documents and generate a tailored answer based on the stored information.
3. **View Logs**:
   - Check the sidebar on the Streamlit interface to view system logs.
   - Logs include all activities, from initialization to question handling and cleanup.
4. **Deinitialize**:
   - Use the "Deinitialize System" button to clean up resources.
   - This ensures that all memory and GPU resources are freed up after usage.
   - Reinitialization will be required if the system is used again after deinitialization.

## Limitations
- **Single Instance**: Only one active instance of the AI Butler can be run at a time.
- **Reinitialization Required**: After deinitialization, the system must be reinitialized before it can be used again.
- **Idle Timeout**: The system automatically resets if left idle for 5 minutes, requiring reinitialization upon next use.
- **Resource Constraints**: Hosted on ngrok (free version), which may limit the availability of resources such as GPU memory and processing power, particularly during periods of high usage.
